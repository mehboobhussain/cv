    <p>Although I have few ideas in my head but these could never be put in the form of a book.
      The first and most important things is to link the ideas together in some structure and then
    group the ideas into topics. The topics could be further grouped into chapters. An index could then be formed for easier navigation.
    All of these can be done either the linked doucments like html or vimwiki. Lets see which tool helps the best.
